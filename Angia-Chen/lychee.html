  <b>Lychee tea </b>(荔枝茶) is a black tea scented by the lychee nut and enjoyed for its strong and pleasantly sweet fruity aroma.
  The brewed tea naturally has a reddish-brown hue.
  <br></br>
  The lychee nut is a small, plum-sized red fruit with a rough outer skin and sweet juicy flesh.
  It grows on trees and is readily picked in mid-summer.
  Due to the Lychee nut's availability, it is commonly found in many parts of the globe.
  It is especially enjoyed by the citizens of the Earth Kingdom.
