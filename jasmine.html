  <b>Jasmine tea </b>(茉莉花茶) is a tea scented with the highly fragrant jasmine flowers.
  It is usually made with green tea, though black and white tea are also used.
  It is the most famous scented tea in China.
  <br></br>
  The jasmine plant was introduced into China from South Asia during the Han Dynasty
  and was used in teas around the fifth century.
  However, jasmine tea did not become widespread until the Qing Dynasty,
  when tea trade with the West became popular.
  <br></br>
  Jasmine is grown at mountainous elevations. To scent the tea,
  flowers are blended with the tea leaves and stored until the tea has absorbed the fragrance
  of the jasmine.
  <br></br>
  Jasmine tea from the Fujian province of China is known to have the best reputation.
  It is also produced in other areas of China as well as in Japan, where it is called Sanpin-cha (さんぴん茶).
