  <b>White dragon tea </b>(白龙花茶) is a tea made from the flowers and leaves of the white dragon bush,
  a rare flowering plant.
  The plant is known for producing a delicious tea, which has led to it being overharvested. It has since become a rarity, and, as such,
  has become highly prized by makers of fine teas.
  <br></br>
  The white dragon bush naturally inhabits the eastern
  Earth Kingdom and grows best in forested areas where there is an abundance of shade.
  <br></br>
  Due to its appearance, it is sometimes confused with the poisonous white jade bush. Ingesting
  the latter causes a severe reaction that can cause swelling of the throat and death. White dragon petals are reddish-pink with white streaks,
  while white jade petals are white with dark-orange streaks.
